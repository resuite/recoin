  "style_name": "Engraving/Etching Style",
  "description": "A formal specification for generating visual assets adhering to a classical engraving or etching style, characterized by fine, detailed line work (hatching and cross-hatching) to create tone and form, based on the provided reference images.",
  "overall_aesthetic": {
    "summary": "Detailed, textural, and traditional, featuring high-contrast monochrome imagery built from meticulous arrangements of fine lines (hatching, cross-hatching, and contour lines) to simulate light, shadow, and form.",
    "impression": "Creates a sense of classical artistry, precision, depth, and textural richness, often associated with historical illustrations, printmaking, and currency design."
  },
  "visual_elements": {
    "perspective": {
      "type": "Linear Perspective (Implied or Explicit)",
      "details": "Generally adheres to principles of linear perspective for realistic depiction, although close-ups may focus primarily on form rendering rather than deep spatial recession. Parallel lines converge towards vanishing points if depicting scenes.",
      "effect": "Provides a realistic sense of depth, volume, and spatial relationships appropriate to the subject matter."
    },
    "dimensionality": {
      "representation": "3D forms rendered using 2D line techniques.",
      "technique": "Volume, shading, and texture are conveyed entirely through the meticulous application of hatching (parallel lines), cross-hatching (intersecting lines), stippling (dots - less prominent in refs but related), and contour lines that follow the form's surface.",
      "clarity": "High clarity of form achieved through the skillful modulation of line density and direction to represent light and shadow."
    },
    "line_art": {
      "quality": "Precise, fine, controlled, and deliberate lines.",
      "weight": "Typically very fine and consistent line weight. Apparent thickness or darkness is achieved through the density and layering of lines (cross-hatching), not by varying the weight of individual lines.",
      "style": "Dominated by hatching and cross-hatching patterns. Lines often curve to follow the contours of the represented surface. Outlines may be present but are often subtle or integrated into the shading lines.",
      "continuity": "Lines are continuous within their hatching paths. Dense areas are built up from many individual, distinct lines."
    },
    "color_palette": {
      "scheme": "Strictly Monochrome",
      "variants": [
        "Black lines on an off-white, cream, or light tan background (simulating aged paper).",
        "Occasionally, dark brown or sepia lines on a similar background."
      ],
      "contrast": "High contrast between the ink lines and the paper background is essential for the style's clarity and impact."
    },
    "shading_and_texture": {
      "shading": "Achieved exclusively through line techniques. Density, direction, and layering of hatching/cross-hatching determine tonal values from light to dark.",
      "texture": "Surface textures (skin, fabric, hair, metal) are simulated through specific patterns, densities, and directions of the line work. The line work itself creates the texture.",
      "exceptions": "None. Shading and texture are integral to the line-based rendering method."
    },
    "composition": {
      "arrangement": "Typically follows principles of realistic representation, including portraiture, anatomical studies, narrative scenes, or detailed object rendering.",
      "spacing": "Determined by the realistic depiction of the subject and its environment.",
      "negative_space": "The un-inked paper background represents the lightest areas and highlights, playing a crucial role in defining form through contrast.",
      "balance": "Often employs classical compositional balance (rule of thirds, etc.) suited to realistic or illustrative work."
    },
    "geometry_and_form": {
      "simplification": "Low simplification. Aims for a high degree of naturalism or realism in representing forms and surfaces.",
      "edges_and_corners": "Edges are defined by the termination of hatched areas, shifts in tonal value created by line density, or sometimes by a fine contour line. Sharpness or softness of edges is controlled by the transition in line work.",
      "consistency": "A high degree of consistency in the application of the line technique across the entire illustration is crucial for a cohesive result."
    },
    "detail_level": {
      "level": "High Detail / Realistic",
      "focus": "Emphasis on accurately rendering form, volume, light, shadow, and surface texture using complex line work.",
      "symbolism": "Can be used for symbolic representation, but the focus of the technique itself is on realistic rendering."
